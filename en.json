  "info.terms.title.difficulty_adjust": "Difficulty Adjustment",
  "info.terms.definition.difficulty_adjust": "Regulates the pace of block production. Occurs every 2016 blocks, approximately every 2 weeks, and targets an average block time of 10 minutes. The adjustment increases and decreases mining difficulty according to the pace of blocks in the previous period. If blocks are too fast the difficulty is increased to slow them down. If blocks are too slow the difficulty decreases.",
  "info.terms.title.epoch": "Epoch",
  "info.terms.definition.epoch": "Period of a particular level of Bitcoin's issuance via block subsidy. Each epoch lasts 210,000 blocks and concludes with a halving event.",

  "info.terms.definition.exchange": "Measurement of Bitcoin's trade value against another currency. Can be viewed in currency units per Bitcoin, or satoshis per currency unit. It should be noted that exchange rates do not exist in the protocol or on the network and are a purely external construct.",
  "info.terms.title.fees": "Fees",
  "info.terms.definition.fees": "Fee rate estimates by priority. Every transaction pays a fee calculated by multiplying the data size of a transaction (vBytes) by the fee rate selected by the sender. Miners generally choose the transactions paying the highest fees. The rates displayed are a suggestion based on the fee rates of other currently unconfirmed transactions.",
  "info.terms.title.halving": "Halving",
  "info.terms.definition.halving": "Regulates the supply of Bitcoin's issuance every 210,000 blocks (roughly every 4 years). Halves the previous epoch's issuance (subsidy) per block.

A winning miner gets the right to choose which transactions in mempool will be confirmed in the block and added to the timechain. This process is how transactions are made final and also how Bitcoin's supply is issued. The block reward (coinbase) includes the fees from all the selected transactions as well as newly issued bitcoin in the amount of the current subsidy.",
  "info.terms.title.nodes": "Nodes",
  "info.terms.definition.nodes": "A node is a computer that connects to the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network using the core protocol to communicate with other nodes on the network. The content of newly mined blocks is shared and added to each node's record of the timechain of blocks. The consensus between all nodes is what secures the immutability of the history of transactions. A Bitcoin user running their own node relies on no 3rd party to confirm their transactions and holdings.",
  "info.terms.title.pow": "Proof of Work",
  "info.terms.definition.pow": "Difficulty adjusted proof of work is essential to the functioning of the bitcoin network. \"The chain with the most work is the truth, by definition.
